# LeLouvre (Symfony Final Project)

My final project of the OOP Framework course, we have seen for several weeks how the Symfony Framework works. Through this project, we will represent the Louvre Museum, a famous museum in Paris. This project whose theme is "The Museum", aims to push the learning of this framework and to validate the final mark of the exam of this 2nd year course.

This website should have these sections:

- Home page
- Gallery
- About
- Team

This application must fully use the architecture of Symfony 6 to display, edit, delete data while respecting the "Museum" theme.
